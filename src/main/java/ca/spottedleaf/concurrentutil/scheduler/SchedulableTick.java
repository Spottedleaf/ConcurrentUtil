/**
 * Represents a tickable task that can be scheduled into a scheduled thread pool.
 * <p>
 * A tickable task is expected to be self scheduled using the {@link #setScheduledStart(long)} during
 * every tick.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A tickable task can have intermediate tasks that can be executed before its tick method is run. Instead of
 * the scheduled thread pool parking in-between ticks, the scheduler may instead drain intermediate tasks from scheduled
 * tasks. The parsing of intermediate tasks allows the scheduler to take advantage of time in-between ticks to reduce the
 * intermediate task load from tasks once they begin ticking or to possibly reduce latency parsing intermediate tasks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is guaranteed that {@link #runTick()} and {@link #runTasks(BooleanSupplier)} are never
 * invoked in parallel.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is required that when intermediate tasks are scheduled, that the scheduler's notify task function
 * is invoked for any scheduled task - otherwise, the scheduler may not parse intermediate tasks.
